The OpenFisheries.org project seeks to advance the practice of data science in fisheries. The project does this by consolidating global fisheries datasets through an open web platform and viewing this data through a lens of modern analytics. The project lead is Andrew Dyck.

The OpenFisheries.org flagship project is the Global Fisheries REST API. Information about using the API is available on Github. Collaboration with the rOpenSci team has produced a package for the R programming language that makes the API accessible for educators and data scientists alike.

And, the indie hacker @mikaeldui has created this .NET package.

You can install it using the following **.NET CLI** command:

    dotnet add package MikaelDui.OpenFisheries --version *
